<h2>Message from the Chair</h2>
    <p>
      Hi everyone. I'm writing with an update on what's been happening in the Mathematics Department at Queens College. 
      You already know that this is a top-tier department within the greatest urban university in the world—a place where 
      you can get a world-class math education at a great price, where renowned faculty are making new discoveries and 
      sharing them with students and the broader community. But you might not know the specifics of what we’ve been up to 
      lately. That’s where this Summer 2025 edition of the <em>Queens Math Bulletin</em> comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the news you'll find in this newsletter, I want to share a bit of personal news. 
      First, let me say what a privilege it has been to serve as Chair of the department over the past two years. 
      I love the Queens College Math Department, and it has been a particular honor to represent so many people doing 
      extraordinary work—for their students, for CUNY, for the mathematical community, and for the world. 
      I’m truly proud of what we’ve accomplished together. Thank you.
    </p>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1rem;">
    <p>
      I’ll be stepping down as Chair this summer to take on a new role as Executive Officer of the PhD Program in Mathematics 
      at the CUNY Graduate Center. As some of you may know, Leo Zippin—who famously solved Hilbert’s fifth problem—was a central 
      figure in our department and, in 1961, founded the PhD program at the Graduate Center, serving as its first Executive Officer. 
      The connection between Queens and the Graduate Center has remained strong ever since. Many of our students have gone on to 
      study there, and several Queens faculty, including Jozef Dodziuk, have served as EO.  Many of us serve on the doctoral faculty.  In fact, join me in congratulating Nick Vlamis and Delaram Kahrobaei as the newest members of the department to serve on the doctoral faculty.
    </p>

  /></p>
</div>
<p>
      While I’ll still be a proud Queens College Math Professor, I’ll be devoting most of my time to my new responsibilities. 
      It’s hard to step away from Queens when there are so many exciting things happening here, but I’m honored to follow in the footsteps 
      of both Zippin and Dodziuk as another Queens professor to lead the PhD program.
    </p>
 <p>
      I hope you all have a wonderful summer, and I look forward to seeing you soon!

<h3 id="charting-the-landscape-of-big-symmetries">Charting the Landscape of Big Symmetries</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Symmetry,</strong> as <strong>Hermann Weyl</strong> put it, <strong>is the idea by which humankind has long sought to ‘comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection.’”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether you are studying molecular bonds, the Standard Model of particle physics, or the tilings that adorn Moorish mosaics, a <em>group action</em> is at work behind the scenes.  These actions transform spaces in ways that respect algebraic structure—and that simple, elegant concept explains many of the remarkable patterns we see in the world.</p>
<p>The actions of small finite groups are classical gems, beautiful and intricately structured.  When the algebraic structure becomes infinite, gets larger the terrain becomes more difficult and there is much to be discovered.  Here at Queens College we have bold researchers are mapping the frontier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WxCwDn8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Russell Miller</a></strong> works with symmetries so large and complex they are called <em>uncomputable</em>.  A world-leader in computability theory, Miller has turned his attention to the absolute Galois Group, which consists of symmetries of the algebraic closure of the field of rational numbers --- it's the <em>ultimate</em> symmetry group of all algebraic equations.  We know the Absolute Galois Group is a huge, profinite object with a mysterious portion that is uncomputable.  Miller’s NSF‑funded project <em>Computability and the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers</em> asks: <em>how much of this group’s essential structure lies in the uncomputable region?</em>  His work opens a new dialogue between mathematical logic and number theory, probing the very limits of what can possibly be known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://vlamis.nyc/">Dr. Nicholas Vlamis</a></strong> pushes the study of symmetries of low dimensional topological objects into the infinite.  Since the early 20th century, mapping class groups have provided an algebraic window into the topology of small, compact surfaces. When a surface accumulates infinitely many handles or punctures—like the so-called “Loch Ness Monster” surface—its symmetries swell into what's called a <strong>big mapping class group</strong>, a group so large it is not even finitely generated.  Backed by a major NSF award (and six consecutive PSC‑CUNY grants), Vlamis leads the field, developing the technical tools and producing foundational results that others build on.  With J. Aramayona, has written the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07950">go‑to survey</a> for younger researchers entering this rapidly growing field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://dragomirsaric.com/">Dr. Dragomir Šarić</a></strong> approaches the same infinite‑type surfaces from an analytic angle.  Decidedly less algebraic, Šarić uses tools like quadratic differentials and measured foliations.  In a celebrated paper <em>Quadratic Differentials and Foliations on Infinite Riemann Surfaces</em> published in the <em><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/duke-mathematical-journal">Duke Mathematical Journal</a></em> he provides the coordinates for “big Teichmüller spaces,” adding a foliation measure criterion for parbolicity in the infinite case, where the technical tools of Teichmuller dynamics and foliation theory are considerably more delicate.</p>

<p>From the algebraic symmetries of equations to the mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces in topology, our faculty are leading the study beyond the classical  horizon, revealing new phenomena and discovering entirely new mathematics.</p>

<h2 id="the-kiely-hallway-project">The Kiely Hallway Project</h2>
<p>Once an ordinary passageway outside <strong>Kiely 243</strong>, this corridor has been completely reimagined as a living gallery—a space where the elegance and history of mathematics come alive. Now, the thousands of students who walk its length each semester pass through a vibrant mathematical environment and gather beneath bright windows overlooking the Kiely courtyard to pause, reflect, and connect.</p>
<p>Inspired by the design ethos of <strong><a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a></strong> and the playful spirit of <strong><a href="https://momath.org/">MoMath</a></strong>, the hallway tells many stories. One section charts the epic history of mathematics, anchored by Charles Eames’s iconic <em>Minds of Mathematics</em> poster (check out <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/5H0Ym1gBsVY">Daniel Ostroff on the Eames Men of Modern Mathematics IBM Timeline</a></strong> on YouTube). Large‑scale mathematical artworks turn corners into destinations, and five bright digital displays offer vivid glimpses into the lives of influential mathematicians, student achievements, and the vast career possibilities a math degree can unlock.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
<div style="flex: 1">
  <p>On a central wall sits the <a href="https://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/math/made-gallery/">Mathematical Art Digital Exhibition (MADE@QC)</a>.  QR codes invite viewers to learn more about the artists and to learn more about sphere inversion, torus knots, and the many other mathematical ideas behind each piece in the rotating collection.  Curated by artist and mathematician <a href="https://christopherhanusa.com/">Chris Hanusa</a> the exhibition drew hundreds of submissions from artists across dozens of countries.</p>

  />
</div>
<p>In a nod to both past and future, two antique phone booths have been repurposed to house interactive iPad kiosks, inviting visitors to explore mathematical apps and games. With comfortable benches and charging stations, the hallway is no longer just a conduit—it’s now a destination, a space to gather and to discover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Mathematics is a beautiful subject with many fascinating applications.”</strong></p>

<p>This transformation, made possible by the vision and generosity of our alumni and  faculty, stands as a testament to that belief.</p>

<h3 id="a-number%E2%80%91theoretic-quest-spanning-generations">A Number‑Theoretic Quest Spanning Generations</h3>
<p>The department proudly celebrates <strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M5VQj5cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Maria Sabitova</a></strong> for her landmark paper <em>A Number‑Theoretic Classification of Toroidal Solenoids</em> published in <strong><em>Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.</em></strong> in 2024.  Her single‑author, 43‑page tour‑de‑force completes a problem that has challenged mathematicians for nearly a century.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
   <img

    alt="Maria Sabitova"  
    style="max-width:200px; height:auto; margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 2rem; margin-bottomw: 1rem; "
  />
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>Toroidal solenoids arise in dynamical systems, and classifying their cohomology groups breaks down naturally by dimension.  Vietoris and Dantzig began the one‑dimensional case in the 1920s, and Baer solved it in 1937 when he presented a complete invariant.  Higher dimensions resisted every attempt—until Sabitova introduced new number‑theoretic tools in 2022 to settle the two‑dimensional case, then extended those ideas to solve the classification problem for all dimensions.  Her work is a stunning example of how perseverance and innovation can unlock a seemingly intractable problem.</p>

<h3 id="a-productive-sabbatical">A Productive Sabbatical</h3>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
<div style="flex: 1">
  <p>
<a href="https://kapelner.com/publications"><strong>Dr. Adam Kapelner</strong></a> is known for applying sharp statistical thinking in unexpected arenas—from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267537">book‑cover bias</a> to <a href="https://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481(23)00420-7/abstract">machine‑learning analysis of depression treatments</a>. During his recent sabbatical, he turned that same precision toward a fundamental question: *What is the ideal role of randomness in experimental design?*
<p>At the heart of every experiment lies a tension. Randomization is meant to eliminate bias, yet pure randomness can—by chance—produce a wildly unbalanced result. Imagine a clinical trial where, just by luck, all the younger patients end up in the same treatment group.</p>
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>The pairwise‑matching design is optimal under extreme noise and extreme assignments.</em></blockquote>
</div>
 <img
    src="images/adam.jpg"
    alt="Adam Kapelner"  
    style="max-width:180px; height:auto; margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 2rem; margin-bottomw: 1rem; "
  />
</div>
<p>Exploring that tension became the focus of Kapelner’s sabbatical year, resulting in a series of new theorems and publications.  In <strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anzs.12403">a March 2025 paper in <em>STAT</em></a></strong>, Kapelner (with Krieger and Azriel) defines a precise optimality criteria and rigorously proves that the best design must be less random than complete randomization, yet more random than any deterministic allocation.</p>
<p>The results are of more than theoretical interest.  They  offer researchers crucial theoretical clarity for building robust experiments.</p>

<p>Designed for graduate-level study, the book offers a seamless blend of analysis and geometry, with over 350 thoughtfully constructed exercises and clear historical framing. According to the <a href="https://old.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/a-course-in-complex-analysis">MAA Review</a>, Zakeri’s style “sets this book apart” from more conventional texts, making it ideal both for classroom teaching and independent exploration.

<h2 id="critical-math-a-moving-conversation">Critical Math: A Moving Conversation</h2>
<p>The Math Department is proud to be a sponsor of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/critical-math/">Critical Math</a> — an experimental, human-scale mathematical retreat cofounded by Queens College's own <a href="https://www.scottwilsonmath.com/">Scott Wilson</a>.  The inaugural gathering, taking place this summer in Germany’s Black Forest, brings together a small, interdisciplinary group of mathematicians and mathematically curious thinkers for a week of cycling, conversation, and collaborative reflection centered on the theme: <em>Cohomological and homotopical methods in complex geometry.</em></p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

    <blockquote><em>By incorporating cycling into the very structure of the event, we aim to highlight how the same good practices that help keep the planet healthy also enhance our intellectual and physical well-being"
    </em></blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Critical Math is no ordinary conference.  Academic sessions are held in 2–3 hour blocks, where invited speakers discuss open problems that they think the audience might be able to help solve.  Each session encourages deep engagement, with speakers having enough time to provide background and detailed descriptions of challenges.</p>
<p>Between sessions, participants share meals and take to the road, cycling through the scenic valleys of the Black Forest.  Their route includes stops at renowned mathematical institutions such as the famous <a href="https://www.mfo.de/">Oberwolfach Research Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Math is, after all, a collective and social practice. Critical Math invites us to reconsider how we come together to share in its experience.</p>
<p>We wish them a joyful and inspiring event — and hope it will be the first of many.</p>

  <strong>Dr. Zev Klagsbrun ’06</strong>—in collaboration with <strong>Dr. Noam Elkies</strong> of Harvard—has broken an 18-year record by unveiling an elliptic curve with <strong>rank 29</strong>, the highest ever discovered.

  Elliptic curves are foundational to number theory and modern cryptography. While most have rank 0 or 1, rare outliers like this one exhibit strikingly complex rational point structures. 
  It remains an open question whether curves of arbitrarily high rank exist—and the Elkies–Klagsbrun result pushes the boundaries of what is known.

      <p>
  For the past three years, our <strong>Discoveries in Math Lecture Series</strong> has brought world-renowned mathematicians to campus to speak directly with undergraduates about some of the most important discoveries in modern mathematics.  Past speakers have included 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitang_Zhang"><strong>Yitang Zhang</strong></a> (of Twin Prime Conjecture fame), 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Hubbard"><strong>John Hubbard</strong></a> (a pioneer of complex dynamics), and 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshay_Venkatesh"><strong>Akshay Venkatesh</strong></a> (2018 Fields Medalist).
</p>
<p>
  The series remains a highlight of the fall semester, drawing standing room crowds to our largest lecture halls.
